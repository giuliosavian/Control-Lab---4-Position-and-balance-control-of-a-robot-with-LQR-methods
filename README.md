<!-- INTRO OF THE PROJECT -->
## Activity goal

The purpose of this laboratory activity is to design and test a longitudinal state–space controller
for the two–wheeled balancing robot (also referred as “two–wheeled inverted pendulum robot”, or “Segway–like robot”) available in laboratory. The controller is designed to simultaneously stabilize the robot body to its upward vertical position, and the robot base to a desired longitudinal position
set-point. The design is performed by resorting to a simplified model of the robot dynamics, obtained by assuming that the motion occurs along a straight line (i.e. the lateral or heading–angle dynamics is ignored).

The project will touch:
1. Analytical model of the balancing robot
2. Tilt estimation
3. State–space balance–and–position control
4. Simulink model of the balancing robot (numerical simulations)
5. Balance–and–position state–space control using LQR methods
6. Experimental tests

<!-- Get started -->
## Get Started

For start:
1. Download and install matlab/simulink
2. Download and install the related toolbox


## Project organization

There are two folden:
1. The "Simulation folden" is used before the lab for tune and write the algorithm with model base design approch
2. "Realtest folden" rapresent the real data collected during the lab
